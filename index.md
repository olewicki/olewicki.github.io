# Bio

I'm Doriane Olewicki, born and raised in Belgium. I moved to Canada for my studies in 2018. I'm fluent in French and English.

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal in affiliation with the Mila, under the supervision of Sarath Chandar and Bram Adams. I started my PhD in September 2020.

Since July 2019, I 'm collaborating with La Forge, Ubisoft Montréal on first my Master's research and thesis, and now on my Ph.D. research.

# Research interests

Lifelong learning for Software Engineering, Concept Drift, Machine Learning, Continuous Integration, Software analytics tools.

I aim to evaluate how concept drift impacts the evolution of SE development and the performance of automated (ML) tools over time, focusing on several use cases related to continuous integration at Ubisoft. Furthermore, I want to mitigate the impact of concept drift, using methods of lifelong learning, but also study how the detection of characteristics of concept drift can be used to trigger model updates and to select training datasets.


My Master's thesis was called *On the Cost and Value of Build Automation*.
